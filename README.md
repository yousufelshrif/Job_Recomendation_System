# AI-Powered Job Recommendation System

A sophisticated job recommendation system that uses AI to match job seekers with relevant job opportunities based on their skills and job descriptions.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Matching**: Utilizes Sentence-BERT for semantic understanding of job descriptions and user skills
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Fast and efficient job matching using cosine similarity
- **RESTful API**: Easy-to-use API endpoints for job and user processing
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design for easy maintenance and scaling
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive notebooks for data exploration and model development
- **Documentation**: Detailed technical documentation and API references
