## ✨ How You Can Contribute

### 🔧 Code Contributions

* Add new AI recommendation strategies (e.g. hybrid models)
* Improve embeddings (e.g. use BERT, fine-tuning)
* Refactor or extend API routes
* Add model evaluation metrics (e.g. nDCG, MRR)

### 📄 Documentation

* Help write docs in `/docs/` (architecture, usage, pipeline)
* Add docstrings to services or models
* Improve developer onboarding (README, CONTRIBUTING)

### ✅ Testing

* Write tests for services in `tests/services/`
* Add test coverage for model scoring, filtering, embedding logic

### 🐛 Bug Reports & Feature Requests

* File issues on GitHub for bugs, enhancements, or architectural suggestions
* Include clear steps to reproduce any bugs
